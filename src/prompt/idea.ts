export const INSTRUCTION = `## Instructions for Creating an Idea Note

An **Idea** note clearly captures and preserves a concept, thought, or suggestion. Unlike structured documents or meeting summaries, the goal is simplicity, clarity, and completeness.

An idea note does not require structured sections (like participants, decisions, or tasks). Instead, it should fully and directly capture the essence of the idea.

- If the idea is brief, capture it as concise bullet points.
- If detailed or lengthy, summarize it clearly in paragraphs, ensuring no critical information is omitted.

**Detailed Idea (Paragraphs):**

\`\`\`markdown
## Idea

Clearly describe the core concept or thought in the first paragraph, providing enough context to convey its purpose or potential immediately.
