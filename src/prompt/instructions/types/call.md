# Call

Task #1 - Organize information from a transcript of an audio recording of you reporting on a call with an individual or group of individuals.

Task #2 - Analyze your transcript and determine the participants, who initiated the call, what tasks and follow-up actions were discussed, and what outcomes and decisions were discussed.

Task #3 - Produce a note in Markdown format that is roughly the same length or longer than the original transcript of your audio recording, and retain as much detail as is present in the original transcript.

If there is information in the <context> section, use that information in the context to help you identify people, projects, plans, and other entities mentioned in the transcript.

## Instructions for Generating a Call Summary Note

A "call"-type note typically captures details about a telephone conversation, Zoom call, or Microsoft Teams call, and it captures essential details such as attendees, main activities, outcomes, follow-up actions, and the direction of call initiation.

Capture all of the thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and information shared in the transcript being careful not to change the meaning or content of the transcript as it is written.

## Call Title

The title should clearly reflect the subject or purpose of the call. Determine the title with the following priority:

1. Explicitly stated by you at the beginnign of your recording ("call regarding sales targets").
2. Clearly identified subject discussed during the call.
3. General context inferred if no explicit title is mentioned.

If the title is not explicitly stated, indicate this explicitly:

```markdown
Title: *(Title not explicitly identifiedâ€”suggested: "Sales Target Discussion")*
```

If the title isn't clear, use the subject from the transcript.

## Participants

List all individuals mentioned as being present on the call:

```markdown
## Participants
- John Smith
- Jane Doe
- Alex Johnson
```

## Call Initiation

Clearly indicate who initiated the call:

- If you initiated the call: "Here are notes on the call I had with John Smith today.  I called him to discuss..."
- If someone else initiated the call: "I received a call from [Caller's Name]."
- If unclear: Explicitly state uncertainty, e.g., "I can't rememebr who called who, but I had a conversation with..."

```markdown
## Call Initiation
I called Andy around Noon on his cell phone to discuss the status of the project.
```

## Tasks and Follow-Up Actions

Tasks or follow-up actions mentioned explicitly in the transcript should be listed clearly. Classify each task if relevant:

- **Urgent:** Requires immediate attention or specific near-term deadlines.
- **Overdue:** Mentioned explicitly as already past due.

Share tasks in a bulleted list:

```markdown
## Tasks and Follow-Up Actions
- [Urgent] Schedule follow-up meeting with marketing by Thursday.
- [Overdue] Submit quarterly sales report immediately.
```

## Outcomes and Decisions

Clearly document any outcomes, agreements, or decisions made during the call. Sharing the details succinctly and clearly:

```markdown
## Outcomes and Decisions
- Agreement reached to increase sales targets by 10%.
- Decision made to postpone the product launch until next quarter.
```

## Call Details (Body)

The Body section should contain a structured readout of the call capturing the topics, activities, and subjects you discussed in the meeting.  

The readout should also contain any information about how the meeting unfolded, what was said, and what was decided in a more detailed format than the other sections.

If you offer your own analysis of the call, include that in the readout as well.

Include information clearly and concisely, ensuring accuracy regarding any significant details:

```markdown
## Call Details
John called me around Noon and started to talk about what he did on the weekend before anyone dialed.  We discussed his upcoming golf trip, but then we were interrupted when Sunny dialed in and we were getting ready to start discussing the plan. The team dialied in and we started about constraints in the budget, and eventually it became clear that no one was aware of the impending economic crisis."
```

If you explicitly request verbatim text in the transcript, try to record that content as directly as possible.   If the you say, "There was an interesting quote from Jackie, she said, 'The mountains are green and the sky is blue'", then the verbatim text should be in the note.

If you say, "Capture the follow text word for word", or "I'll quote John directly," then the information following that statement should be included with quotes as verbatim text.

```markdown
**Verbatim Dictation:**  
In the meeting, John commented to me, "We must finalize the sales strategy document by the end of this week and ensure that all stakeholders review it immediately."
```
