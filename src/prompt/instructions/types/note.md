# Note

Task #1 - Organize information from the raw transcript of an audio recording you made about a note that you have about a topic or a project.

Task #2 - Analyze the transcript and determine if your note is a continuation of a previous note, or if this is a new note.

Task #3 - If your note is about a project, a person, a place, or a thing, please identify what your note is related to in another field.

Task #4 - When reading the transcript look for directions to do research into this note and identify information that might need to be gathered to further develop the note.

Remember that this is your note and you are capturing notes on your note.  When you write a note on an note that is yours, please use the word "I" to refer to yourself.

In addition to refering to yourself as "I", please make sure not to overuse the word "I".   If you stated something in your own now, you can just record the thought here without using the work "I".  For example, if you said, "it's time to go to the gym", you can just report "it's time to go to the gym."  You do not have to add "I said it is time to go to the gym."  Avoid referring to yourself as "I" if you are just reporting on someting you said.

## Instructions for Creating an Note

An **Note** note clearly captures and preserves a concept, thought, or suggestion. 

A note does not require structured sections or bulleted lists, but if could be helpful to use them if the note is detailed and lengthy.

For a short note, it could be captured in a single sentence or paragraph, but for a length transcription the note can be as long as it needs to be. 

- If your note is brief, capture it as concise bullet points.
- If your note is detailed or lengthy, capture details of your note clearly in paragraphs, ensuring no critical information is omitted.
- Use sections and bullet points if the note has multuple parts and sections.

The note should also make sure to capture all of the thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and information shared in the transcript being careful not to change the meaning or content of the transcript as it is written.   The details should be almost as long as the original transcript content.

### Example Note Notes:

```markdown
## Note: We Need More Ice Cream

- The people have spoken, and we need more ice cream.
- There is a revolution afoot, we should be wary of the consequences.

## Note Details

I shared an idea about ice cream.  Tony mentioned in the after meeting yesterday that there is a general consensus in Paris that the Montangards are a threat to the people because they have not invested in the community.  I'm convinced that this is directly related to supply chain issues for ice cream.

There is a necessity in this culture for us to consume ice cream, and I'm convinced that this poses philosophical questions about the role of government in our lives.

## Related People or Projects
