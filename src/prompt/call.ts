export const INSTRUCTION = `## Instructions for Generating a Call Summary Note

A "call"-type note typically summarizes a telephone conversation, capturing essential details such as attendees, main activities, outcomes, follow-up actions, and the direction of call initiation.

Clearly indicate any missing details when necessary.

### Call Title

The title should clearly reflect the subject or purpose of the call. Determine the title with the following priority:

1. Explicitly stated by the speaker ("call regarding sales targets").
2. Clearly identified topic discussed during the call.
3. General context inferred if no explicit title is mentioned.

If the title is not explicitly stated, indicate this explicitly:

\`\`\`markdown
Title: *(Title not explicitly identifiedâ€”suggested: "Sales Target Discussion")*
\`\`\`

### Participants

List all individuals mentioned as being present on the call:

\`\`\`markdown
## Participants
- John Smith

- Alex Johnson
\`\`\`

### Call Initiation

Clearly indicate who initiated the call:

- If the speaker initiated: "This call was initiated by the speaker."
- If someone else initiated: "This call was received by the speaker from [Caller's Name]."
- If unclear: Explicitly state uncertainty, e.g., "The call initiator was not clearly identified."

\`\`\`markdown
## Call Initiation

\`\`\`

### Tasks and Follow-Up Actions

Tasks or follow-up actions mentioned explicitly in the transcript should be listed clearly. Classify each task if relevant:

- **Urgent:** Requires immediate attention or specific near-term deadlines.
- **Overdue:** Mentioned explicitly as already past due.

Summarize tasks in a bulleted list:

\`\`\`markdown
## Tasks and Follow-Up Actions
- [Urgent] Schedule follow-up meeting with marketing by Thursday.
- [Overdue] Submit quarterly sales report immediately.
\`\`\`

### Outcomes and Decisions

Clearly document any outcomes, agreements, or decisions made during the call. Summarize succinctly and clearly:

\`\`\`markdown
## Outcomes and Decisions
- Agreement reached to increase sales targets by 10%.
- Decision made to postpone the product launch until next quarter.
\`\`\`

### Call Summary (Body)

The Body section should contain a structured summary capturing the key points, activities, topics discussed, and important highlights or statements from the call.

Include information clearly and concisely, ensuring accuracy regarding any significant details:

\`\`\`markdown
## Call Summary
The call primarily focused on reviewing current sales performance and setting future targets. John Smith discussed the potential to increase targets by leveraging new marketing strategies. Jane Doe agreed to provide additional market analysis by the next meeting.
\`\`\`

If the speaker explicitly requests verbatim text, clearly format this:

\`\`\`markdown
**Verbatim Dictation:**  
"We must finalize the sales strategy document by the end of this week and ensure that all stakeholders review it immediately."
\`\`\`
