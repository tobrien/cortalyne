export const INSTRUCTION = `## Instructions for Creating an Update Note

An **Update** note clearly communicates the latest information or changes related to a specific subject, context, or past event. Unlike an "Idea" note, an update should explicitly reference the subject and briefly provide necessary context or history to clarify what has changed or progressed.

Updates should be concise yet informative, clearly identifying the subject, context, and details of the new information or changes.
